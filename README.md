# Groundwater_Level_Regression_Model
Groundwater levels serve as a crucial gauge of environmental quality, reflecting water availability, susceptibility to droughts, and water quality. Consequently, groundwater levels can effectively serve as a reliable indicator for assessing environmental condition and can be employed to analyze the correlation between environmental degradation and economic development. Moreover, our project aims to investigate whether disparities in social and economic aspects also play a role in influencing environmental deterioration. Initially, we intend to examine how total production and state domestic product (SDP) affect groundwater levels and subsequently explore how inequalities affect environmental quality.

So we Tested the impact of SDP, Capital Expenditure, Aggregate expenditure and margin of election victory on ground water level using statistical data and running their regression
